# Object-Detection-and-Semantic-Segmentation
This repository features my implementation for CMPUT 328's Assignment 4, where I tackled the challenge of object detection and semantic segmentation on the MNIST Double Digits RGB (MNISTDD-RGB) dataset. The system identifies and locates pairs of digits in 64x64 RGB images and precisely segments each digit with pixel-wise masks.
